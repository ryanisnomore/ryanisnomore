**Note:**  
- For the Discord server stats (members, online, offline), GitHub markdown doesn't natively support live dynamic values. You can use a bot or a service like [Discord Widget](https://discord.com/widget?id=YOUR_SERVER_ID&theme=dark) or Shields.io with your server ID (replace `1111111111111111111` in the badge URL with your actual server ID) for more accurate stats.  
- Update the Discord badge with your server's actual ID for real-time member count.
